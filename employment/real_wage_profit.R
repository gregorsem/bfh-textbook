# TO DO

# at the right a bracket for the distance from the upper dashed line 
# to the x axis "output per worker"  then within that a bottom bracket 
# "real wage"  and above the blue line "profit per worker hour"  

# DONE the vertical axis should be "Real wage, w, and labor productivity" 

# DONE Output per worker is now gamma, not q, 

# DONE Blue line should be labeled "Competition condition"

# DONE its Y intercept should be w^c

# The txt next to the arrow above the line should be : If the w>w^c  
#        profits will be insufficient and firms will leave

# DONE Below the line If w<w^c new firms will be able to make 
#        economic profits and the number of firms will grow
